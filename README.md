tool for creating a swarm based on json blueprint created by swarmgineer

takes input from swarmgineer


TODO
* include size info in outputted schematic
* Seperate out API tests from primary bulk
* Use an actual test swarmlicant
* figure out a better way to manage configs
* figure out how to better find ip...pinging over and over again is not ideal

NOTES
* Sizes start from zero, need to add a feature that takes names instead
