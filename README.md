tool for creating a swarm based on json blueprint created by swarmgineer

takes input from swarmgineer


TODO
* Seperate out API tests from primary bulk
* Use an actual test swarmlicant

NOTES
* Sizes start from zero, need to add a feature that takes names instead
* Does a trove need to know its own ID?
